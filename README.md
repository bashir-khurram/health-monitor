# HealthMonitor

This is Health monitoring system that displays your Blood pressure related values according to date.

This system has two pages

- Landing page which includes login part
- Main dashboard page where you can see your statistics

Data is been updated every 5 seconds to see up-to-date resutls.

Chart is configurable and you are allowed to change values to view it.

Currently, there is not any backend connected to the system. I have used json files to fetch data.
